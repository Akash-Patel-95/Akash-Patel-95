# 👋 Hi, I'm Akash

I am an IT professional supporting enterprise healthcare environments with a focus on endpoint systems, infrastructure operations, and technical troubleshooting.

Outside of work, I maintain a personal home lab to stay current with evolving technologies in infrastructure, networking, and security. This environment helps me continuously improve my technical depth and practical implementation skills.

I value hands-on learning and structured documentation as part of ongoing professional development.
